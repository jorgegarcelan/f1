## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/F1-Analysis-Prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd F1-Analysis-Prediction
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 📊 Usage

To perform analysis and make predictions:

1. **Prepare the data:** Use the scripts in `src/` to clean and prepare race data.
2. **Train a model:** Use the notebooks in `notebooks/` to experiment with models and select the best one.
3. **Generate predictions:** With the scripts in `src/`, you can use trained models to predict outcomes of upcoming races.
